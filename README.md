## Nothing fancy, just testing AutoML with H2O AutoML

All you need is:
* honestly just h2o and pyhton
* anaconda is nice
* numpy if you need it
* pandas (i have no idea what pandas is used for, but the name is great)

The personality-test data is from [openpsychometrics](https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/), atm the model just predicts one answer as y, with the other answers as x. Obviously thats bullshit.

perc = i wrote a java programm (it's not as bad as my python stuff) to evaluate whether the models predictions are worth anything, and decided it would be fun to throw the same parameters into H2O...
