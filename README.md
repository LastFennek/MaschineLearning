## Nothing fancy, just my first AutoML tests with H2O-AutoML


Used:
* honestly just h2o and pyhton
* Jupyter notebook, its nice. (i assume its bad for larger projects (?))
* anaconda is nice
* numpy if you need it
* pandas (i have no idea what pandas is used for, but the name is great)

The personality-test data is from [openpsychometrics](https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/), atm the model just predicts one answer as y, with the other answers as x. Obviously thats bullshit.

perc = i wrote a java programm (it's not as bad as my python/ml stuff) to evaluate whether the models predictions are worth anything, and decided it would be fun to throw the same parameters into H2O...
